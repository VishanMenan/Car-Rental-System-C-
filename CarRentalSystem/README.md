# Car Rental System

A simple console-based **Car Rental System** built in C++ that allows users to:

- Login with a username and password.
- View available car models by manufacturers.
- Rent a car with detailed information provided.
- Confirm or cancel car rental requests.

This project demonstrates the use of basic **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles in C++.

## Example Usage

1. Login: Enter the username (admin) and password (password).    
2. Choose a Manufacturer: Select from a list of car manufacturers.  
3. View Models: See available car models and their details. 
4. Confirm Rental: Rent the car and view the final confirmation.    
5. Exit: Follow prompts to exit the program.    

## Future Enhancements

- Add a database for storing cars and user data.    
- Implement real-time availability checks for cars. 
- Enhance the interface with better error handling and user feedback.
